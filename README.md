Hello,
this is my interactive historical twine narrative story. It was completed in multiple steps over a number of weeks and each individual step/updated version history is accessible in this repository. It specifically covers a period in Tudor history called the Battle of Pinkie and allows the reader to hypothetically reenact both historcially accurate and inaccurate decisions and actions as the Scottish commander in the battle in order to learn more about the event. The story has conditionals, stylized text, and multimedia. Enjoy.
